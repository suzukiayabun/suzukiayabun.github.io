                    <p>Dr. Kazuyuki Samejima is a Professor of Computational Neuroscience at Brain Science Institute of Tamagawa University. He received his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology(TUAT), and his PhD in electronics and information science from the graduate school of TUAT. He then received a postdoctoral training in computational neuroscience in Dr. Mitsuo Kawato’s dynamic-brain project in JST,ERATO at Advanced telecommunication research laboratories, Kyoto. Then, he joined Dr. Kenji Doya’s “Creating the brain” project in CREST, JST. He also received training of neurophysiology through collaboration with Dr. Minoru Kimura’s lab at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine. His current research focuses on the brain mechanisms of decision making, including the role of basal ganglia in reinforcement learning, and also brain mechanism of social communications, especially through non-verbal social signals such as eye contact, shared attention and body movements. </p>

            <h1>Research Interests</h1>
            <h2>Neural mechanisms of decision making and learning</h2>
            <p>　We are studying the neural mechanisms of how our decision-making is processed in the brain. How do we decide what to do? The goodness or badness of the outcome after a choice adapts our behavior better. But where and how does the brain do that? How do we accumulate experience? How are situational judgments made? What do we pursue as rewards? What conflicts do we face in our interactions with others?<br>
                　To understand the mechanisms of decision-making, we are challenging these questions not only through experimental methods such as neurophysiology, non-invasive brain activity measurement techniques, and cognitive psychology/behavioral experiments, but also by combining them with computational theories that provide mathematical models of decision-making, such as artificial intelligence, economics, psychology, and behavioral ecology.

            <p class="topic">Research Topics</p>
            <h2>1.Value functions and representation learning in the basal ganglia</h2>
            <p>Electrophysiological and brain imaging studies have shown that the basal ganglia play an important role in reward-based decision making. We are studying how neural activities are represented during decision making at the level of individual neurons. Previous studies have shown that information about the value of predicting future rewards is represented in each choice, and that information about the value of chosen target before choosing a movement is represented in neuronal activity in the striatum of the basal ganglia.<br>
                We use electrophysiological methods to measure neural activity in monkeys during behavior and the theory of reinforcement learning to study neural representations and algorithms. How are neural circuits in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia involved in "choice" to make use of past experiences in the future? My goal is to elucidate the mechanism of decision making, such as how information processing is abnormal in neurological diseases such as addiction.
                </p>
            <h2>2.Mechanisms for Generating Communication Symbols</h2>
            <p>Our actions are not only to move around in our environment or manipulate objects, but also to communicate with others. Using symbols to communicate our intentions to others is one of our essential abilities to cooperate with others. But how do we learn, agree with others, and use it as communicative language? <br>
                　To understand the neural mechanisms that allow us to communicate with others in written and spoken language, we are using an experimental paradigm in which subjects form agreements with the meaning of symbols and cooperate with others. These learning behaviors in the paradigm could be modeled by using Bayesian prediction framework and reinforcement learning. This will help to reveal the evolutionary nature of language learning and the innate biases that humans have. Our goal is to clarify the basic principles of language communication and the nature of learning.
                </p>
            <h2>3.Psychological and neural basis of human-animal communication</h2>
            <p>People also communicate using non-verbal information. Through gestures, nods, gazes, facial expressions, etc., we can infer the cognitive state (what we understand or not) and emotional state (pleasant, unpleasant, happy, sad, etc.) of others, and act accordingly. To understand this mechanism, we can use communication between animals and humans.  It is convenient to study about non-verbal communication because animals are not capable of verbal understanding . Domesticated animals, such as dogs and horses, have been shown to be able to use human emotional states and gaze information. Nonverbal communication becomes more effective as the bond is formed. Our goal is to clarify the learning process psychologically and behaviorally, and to elucidate the neural mechanisms by capturing the corresponding changes in the brain.</p>

            <h2>Neurobiology of Decision Making</h2>
            <p>A neuroscientist (or neurobiologist) is a scientist who has specialised knowledge in the field of neuroscience, the branch of biology[1] that deals with the physiology, biochemistry, anatomy and molecular biology of neurons and neural circuits and especially their association with behaviour and learning.[2] Camillo Golgi (1843–1926), Italian physician, neuroscientist, and namesake of the Golgi apparatus Neuroscientists generally work as researchers within a college, university, government agency, or private industry setting.[3] In research-oriented careers, neuroscientists typically spend their time designing and carrying out scientific experiments that contribute to the understanding of the nervous system and its function. They can engage in basic or applied research. Basic research seeks to add information to our current understanding of the nervous system, whereas applied research seeks to address a specific problem, such as developing a treatment for a neurological disorder. Biomedically-oriented neuroscientists typically engage in applied research. Neuroscientists also have a number of career opportunities outside the realm of research, including careers in industry, science writing, government program management, science advocacy, and education.[4] These individuals most commonly hold doctorate degrees in the sciences, but may also hold a master's degree. The Neuroscientists day is celebrated on August 1</p>
