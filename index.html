                    <p>Dr. Kazuyuki Samejima is a Professor of Computational Neuroscience at Brain Science Institute of Tamagawa University. He received his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology(TUAT), and his PhD in electronics and information science from the graduate school of TUAT. He then received a postdoctoral training in computational neuroscience in Dr. Mitsuo Kawato’s dynamic-brain project in JST,ERATO at Advanced telecommunication research laboratories, Kyoto. Then, he joined Dr. Kenji Doya’s “Creating the brain” project in CREST, JST. He also received training of neurophysiology through collaboration with Dr. Minoru Kimura’s lab at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine. His current research focuses on the brain mechanisms of decision making, including the role of basal ganglia in reinforcement learning, and also brain mechanism of social communications, especially through non-verbal social signals such as eye contact, shared attention and body movements. </p>

            <h1>Research Interests</h1>
            <h2>Neurobiology of Decision Making</h2>
            <p>A neuroscientist (or neurobiologist) is a scientist who has specialised knowledge in the field of neuroscience, the branch of biology[1] that deals with the physiology, biochemistry, anatomy and molecular biology of neurons and neural circuits and especially their association with behaviour and learning.[2] Camillo Golgi (1843–1926), Italian physician, neuroscientist, and namesake of the Golgi apparatus Neuroscientists generally work as researchers within a college, university, government agency, or private industry setting.[3] In research-oriented careers, neuroscientists typically spend their time designing and carrying out scientific experiments that contribute to the understanding of the nervous system and its function. They can engage in basic or applied research. Basic research seeks to add information to our current understanding of the nervous system, whereas applied research seeks to address a specific problem, such as developing a treatment for a neurological disorder. Biomedically-oriented neuroscientists typically engage in applied research. Neuroscientists also have a number of career opportunities outside the realm of research, including careers in industry, science writing, government program management, science advocacy, and education.[4] These individuals most commonly hold doctorate degrees in the sciences, but may also hold a master's degree. The Neuroscientists day is celebrated on August 1</p>
